NETCODE NOTES
=============
Here's one possible generalization of networked and local play.

There is one central GameAuthority which arbitrates player actions. There are
multiple GameAgents which provide player actions to the authority.

A GameAuthority contains agent slots which can be filled by either local/CPU
or remote players. The agent actions are populated either locally or from server
packets, but neither the GameAgent nor the GameAuthority is aware of this 
distinction.

Both of these sections have access to a Session struct which contains the data
which, for instance, can be rendered by the client program.

struct GameAuthority {
	Session session;
	GameAgent agent_slots[];
	AuthorityEvent event_queue[];
};

struct GameAgent {
	AgentEvent event_queue[];
};
